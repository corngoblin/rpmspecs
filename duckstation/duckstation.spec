DuckStation is a fast and accurate PlayStation 1 emulator, focused on speed, playability, and long-term maintainability.

%prep
# 1) Unpack DuckStation (creates duckstation-0.1-9226/)

# 2) Vendor in Discord-RPC, stripping its top folder
mkdir -p discord-rpc
tar -xzf %{_sourcedir}/%{discord_rpc_file} \
    --strip-components=1 -C discord-rpc

# 3) Inject custom FindDiscordRPC.cmake so find_package(DiscordRPC) works
mkdir -p CMakeModules
cat > CMakeModules/FindDiscordRPC.cmake << 'EOF'
# FindDiscordRPC.cmake â€” locate our vendored static Discord-RPC
